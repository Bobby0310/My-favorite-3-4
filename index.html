        <h1>Hello!! My name is Bobby ,<br> Today im going to tell you about my favorite hobby, SWIMMING!!</h1>
        <p>My Favorite hobby is swimming because I like the being in the water alot. Also it is very hot here in California so the water cools me down alot. Not only that, but I can get fresh air while im doing my favorite hobby. Swimming also helps me keep in shape but beacuse of covid I have not been able to go swimming at all so it's very sad, but I hope when covid is over i can go back to swimming.</p>
